Bananagrams is our residential floor's favorite pasttime activity and so we decided to build it in Python.

We have a client file and a server file that communicate via sockets. Just edit in your IP and open the server and then any number of clients can join in and play the game.

It has a fully functional UI, complete with scrolling and letter placement. It also checks words using a dictionary library and ensures that the board is legally connected.
